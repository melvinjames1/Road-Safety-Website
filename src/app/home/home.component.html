     </h1>
        <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">The streets of India are a vibrant tapestry, bustling with diverse activities, but they also pose significant dangers. The chaotic blend of pedestrians, cyclists, motorcyclists, and a variety of vehicles often creates a challenging environment for road safety. Traffic rules are sometimes loosely followed, leading to a high risk of accidents. Overcrowded streets, inadequate infrastructure, and poorly maintained roads contribute to the hazards. Additionally, the presence of stray animals, unregulated street vendors, and uneven pavements further heighten the risks for both pedestrians and motorists. Despite efforts to improve road safety, the challenges persist, making it essential for all road users to exercise caution and adhere to traffic regulations to navigate the lively yet perilous streets of India.</p>

          <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">1.Use designated crossings: Always cross the road at designated pedestrian crossings such as zebra crossings, pedestrian bridges, or traffic signals.</p>
          <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">2.Obey traffic signals: Wait for the pedestrian signal to turn green before crossing the road. Don't attempt to cross when the signal is red.</p>
          <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">3.Look both ways: Before crossing any road, look left, right, and left again to ensure no vehicles are approaching.</p>
          <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">4.Make eye contact: If crossing in front of a vehicle, try to make eye contact with the driver to ensure they see you before crossing.</p>
          <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">5.Stay visible: Wear bright or reflective clothing, especially when walking at night, to make yourself more visible to drivers.</p>

        </h1>
          <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">1.Wear Protective Gear: Always wear a helmet, gloves, jacket, pants, and sturdy boots to minimize the risk of injury in case of an accident.</p>
        <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">2.Regular Maintenance: Ensure your bike is well-maintained, with regular checks on brakes, tires, lights, and other critical components.</p>
        <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">3.Follow Traffic Rules: Adhere to traffic regulations, including speed limits, traffic signals, and lane discipline. Respect the rules to ensure your safety and that of others on the road.</p>
        <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">4.Stay Visible: Wear bright, reflective clothing, especially during low-light conditions. Make sure your bike has working headlights, taillights, and turn signals.</p>
        <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">5.Defensive Riding: Anticipate the actions of other road users and be prepared for unexpected movements. Assume that others may not see you, and ride defensively.</p>
        <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">6.Avoid Distractions: Stay focused on the road. Avoid using mobile phones or other distractions that can divert your attention from the task of riding.</p>
        <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">7.Maintain a Safe Distance: Keep a safe following distance from the vehicle in front of you. This gives you ample time to react to sudden stops or maneuvers.</p>
        <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">8.Learn and Practice Emergency Maneuvers: Familiarize yourself with emergency braking and swerving techniques. Regularly practice these maneuvers in a safe environment.</p>
        <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">9.Check Weather Conditions: Be aware of the weather forecast before riding. Rain, snow, or extreme heat can impact road conditions and visibility.</p>
        <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">10.Avoid Riding Under the Influence: Never ride under the influence of alcohol or drugs. Impaired judgment significantly increases the risk of accidents.</p>
        <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">11.Stay Mindful of Road Conditions: Watch out for potholes, gravel, and uneven surfaces. Adjust your speed and riding style according to the road conditions.</p>
        <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">12.Use Both Mirrors: Regularly check both rear-view mirrors to be aware of the traffic behind you. This is crucial for making informed decisions while riding.</p>
        <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">13.Be Cautious at Intersections: Exercise extra caution at intersections, as they are common locations for accidents. Look in all directions before proceeding.</p>
        <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">14.Respect Others on the Road: Be considerate to other road users, including pedestrians and cyclists. Give them the right of way when required.</p>
        <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">15.Continuous Skill Improvement: Enroll in advanced rider training courses to enhance your skills and stay updated on the latest safety techniques. Continuous learning can make you a more proficient and safe motorcyclist.</p>
